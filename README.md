# Test App

This project demonstrates clean code principles and design patterns in an Angular application.

# Demo

https://test-app.josematos.work

## Overview

This is a simple Angular application generated with Angular CLI. It includes:

- An Angular library module (my-library)
- Example components, services, models, etc.
- Unit and end-to-end tests
- Continuous integration setup

## Clean Code Practices

The codebase follows principles like:

- Meaningful naming conventions
- Small focused functions/classes
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Consistent code style and formatting
- Extensive commenting for complex logic
- Avoiding deep nesting and complex conditions

## Design Patterns

Some patterns used in the code:

- Dependency Injection for services, repos, etc
- Singleton services
- Model-View-Controller pattern with Angular components
- Repository pattern for abstracting data access
- Pub/sub pattern for event handling
- Strategy pattern for swappable algorithms
- Facade pattern to simplify interfaces

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the project locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start dev server with `ng serve`
4. Run tests with `ng test`
